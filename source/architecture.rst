System Architecture
===================

Overview
--------

This document describes the architecture of our system, providing a high-level overview of the components, their interactions, and design decisions.

The architecture follows a microservices approach with clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces between components. This ensures maintainability, scalability, and flexibility for future extensions.

System Components
----------------

The system consists of the following key components:

1. **User Interface Layer**
   - Web Application (React)
   - Mobile Application (React Native)

2. **API Gateway**
   - Request routing
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting and throttling

3. **Microservices**
   - User Service
   - Product Service
   - Order Service
   - Payment Service
   - Notification Service

4. **Data Layer**
   - PostgreSQL (transactional data)
   - MongoDB (product catalog)
   - Redis (caching)

5. **Infrastructure**
   - Kubernetes for orchestration
   - Message queues for asynchronous communication
   - Monitoring and logging

Communication Patterns
---------------------

The system employs several communication patterns to ensure efficiency and reliability:

1. **Synchronous Communication**
   - REST APIs for direct service-to-service communication
   - GraphQL for complex data requests from clients

2. **Asynchronous Communication**
   - Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
   - Message queues for asynchronous processing
   - Publish-subscribe pattern for notifications

Data Management
--------------

The system uses a polyglot persistence approach, selecting the most appropriate database technology for each use case:

* **PostgreSQL**: For structured, transactional data (users, orders, payments)
* **MongoDB**: For product catalog and content management (flexible schema)
* **Redis**: For caching and session management (fast access)

Security Considerations
----------------------

The architecture incorporates several security measures:

1. Authentication and authorization at the API Gateway
2. Encrypted communication (TLS/SSL)
3. Data encryption at rest
4. Rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. Regular security audits and penetration testing

Deployment Strategy
------------------

The system is deployed using a containerized approach with Kubernetes:

* Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
* Blue-green deployments for zero downtime
* Horizontal scaling for handling increased load
* Automated monitoring and alerting

Conclusion
---------

This architecture provides a robust foundation for our system, balancing performance, scalability, and maintainability. The microservices approach allows independent development and deployment of components, while the clear separation of concerns simplifies maintenance and future enhancements.
